US,"This warm-climate wine is fulsome and hearty in baked Asian pear and candied ginger. A dried-fruit quality stands out on the buxom palate, a buttery taste of dried apricot drizzled in honey and brioche.",Island Block,26,California,Alexander Valley,Chardonnay,Murphy-Goode
France,"Fifty-year-old vines are the backbone to this firm wine. Mint and smoky wood-aging flavors give a dry, dense character.

US,"This is the first release from a new, two-acre vineyard devoted to this old-school clone. It's what might be called sculpted, with excellent definition among all the components.

US,"Crisp in green apple and lemon, this light Chardonnay, only 12.4% in alcohol, will sweep you off your feet with Thai food, seafood or as a before-dinner quaff. From an un-grafted, old Wente clone vineyard found abandoned (thus the name), it has a trace of salinity throughout and a lurking layer of Asian spice.",Untended,35,California,Anderson Valley,Chardonnay,Donkey & Goat
Italy,"Intense aromas include crushed tomato vine, elderflowers, hay and tropical fruit. The vibrant palate offers yellow peach, kiwi, honeydew melon and a hint of lemon pastry alongside crisp acidity.",Castel Ringberg,25,Northeastern Italy,Alto Adige,Sauvignon,Elena Walch

Bright, grippy and layered, the finish offers toasty oak.",Stony Terrace,55,California,Anderson Valley,Pinot Noir,Black Kite

France,"A dark and brooding wine, it's very much a Malbec that needs to age. Solid tannins, berry fruits and concentrated structure all promise a serious wine that needs time to mature. Drink from 2017.",CuvÌ©e Prestige,44,Southwest France,Cahors,Malbec,ChÌ¢teau de CÌ©nac
France,"This impressive wood-aged wine has weight, rich black and red berry flavors and a smooth, unctuous texture. With its concentration, ripeness, acidity and tannins, it could age through 2016.",La RÌ©serve du ChÌ¢teau,30,Beaujolais,Brouilly,Gamay,ChÌ¢teau de Pierreux
US,"A small planting of an unusual ‰ÛÏUpright‰Û clone yields this fragrant, smoky, lightly earthy Pinot Noir. Chock full of briary red fruits, it's a tart, lip-smacking wine, drinking well in its youth, but also positioned (via bracing acidity) for further years of bottle age. The young fruit gives a pretty, cherry candy note to the finish.",The Morgster,30,Oregon,Eola-Amity Hills,Pinot Noir,Angel Vine
US,"This is a tannic, acidic, hard-to-appreciate wine due to the cold conditions of the 2011 vintage. But the wine, which is 100% Cabernet and was aged in 50% new French oak, still is a great success, testimony to skillful viticultural and winemaking practices. With a solid core of black currants, it wants until 2020 in the cellar.",Maxine's Vineyard,55,California,Yountville,Cabernet Sauvignon,Bardessono
Spain,"Dusty aromas of yellow apple and cream soda are creamier than the palate, which is tangy, lemony and green. This tastes of briny citrus and green apple, while tangerine, lime and green-herb flavors define the finish.",Brut,16,Catalonia,Cava,Sparkling Blend,El XamfrÌÊ
Spain,"Plum and berry aromas are lively and come with a mild scent of animal fur. This blend of four grapes, led by Tempranillo, feels blocky and loosely defined, while flavors of plum, raspberry and a touch of herbal green finish spicy and woody. Will function best as an everyday wine.",ViÌ±a Aljibes Cabernet  Sauvignon-Syrah-Cabernet Franc-Tempranillo,20,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,Red Blend,Aljibes

Spain,"Stripped-back cherry and raspberry flavors take on a jammy character with airing. This is tight, bright and mildly acidic on the palate, with raspberry, red plum and brown sugar flavors. Toast and a molasses-like sweetness carry an otherwise juicy finish.",ViÌ±a Berceo Crianza,18,Northern Spain,Rioja,Tempranillo Blend,Bodegas Berceo

US,"Here is a well-focused wine with appealing toastiness as soon as it's opened. Fruit flavors are still tight, but unfold into tangy raspberry. It spent 18 months in half new French oak, to good effect.",Roads End Estate Vineyard,45,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Carlton Cellars
Spain,"Blackberry, cherry and earthy aromas are backed by a secondary wave of oaky char. This is 80% Garnacha and 20% Carignan with raw clamp to the palate created by grabby tannins and tomatoey acidity. Briny raspberry and plum flavors finish with rubbery tannins and related grab. This is a tough wine but one with lots of life and power. Drink through 2019.",Pinyolet SelecciÌ?n,19,Catalonia,Montsant,Red Blend,CompaÌ±ia de Vinos del AtlÌÁntico
US,"Closed on the nose at first, this wine reventualy reveals black currant and cassis around wrapped tobacco leaf, the midpalate somewhat dry and puckering in tannin. Concentrated and dense, it finishes in dusty mocha.",Black Label Stepping Stone,45,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Cornerstone
US,"Made from a majority of Cabernet Franc, complemented with a small handful of Merlot, the wine is aged in new French oak half barrels. Tannic and savory in cassis and cranberry, the wine also shows a trace of black tea and tomato leaf. The wine's oak remains extremely pronounced, which suggests some time in cellar, through 2020.",Will Jarvis' Science Project,135,California,Napa Valley,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Jarvis
France,"Pure NÌ©grette produces a smooth, black cherry and red berry-flavored wine. Light hints of wood from aging in big barrels have helped to give the wine a rich and spicy character.

Italy,"A hearty blend of Merlot and Cabernet, this opens with aromas of cedar, vanilla, underbrush and black currant.

Italy,"Made entirely from Tempranillo‰ÛÓa rarity in Italy‰ÛÓthis opens with aromas of blue flowers, plum and a whiff of leather.

US,"Showing a slightly coppery blush hue, this softly aromatic wine has a pleasing muskiness. It's high acid, slightly spritzy, clean and fresh. Though perfectly quaffable, it's not a typical Oregon Pinot Gris.",Blacktail Vineyard,15,Oregon,Oregon,Pinot Gris,Siltstone
US,"Fruity and forward, with a spritzy mouthfeel, this is like a bowl of cherries, with a cherry candy finish. Highlights of orange and grapefruit come through also. Drink now through 2016.",3 Clones,40,Oregon,Chehalem Mountains,Pinot Noir,Vidon Vineyard
US,"The vineyard was planted in the early 1970s, and this wine shows some old-vine complexity. It's an elegant drink, with a nicely finessed fruit and acid balance. Light and clean flavors suggest watermelon and raspberry with a hint of cherry.",Wirtz Vineyard Reserve,40,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Walnut City WineWorks
France,"With vines in the northeast of the Gers region, this winery produces impressively ripe red wines. This wood-aged and spicy wine is still young and needs time to integrate the wood with the red berry fruits. It does have weight and potential richness, so give it until 2016.",La Croix d'Arton,12,Southwest France,CÌ«tes de Gascogne,Red Blend,Domaine d'Arton

France,"Very dry, with a firm mineral content, this rosÌ© really needs food. Fresh red currant and raspberry fruitiness are surrounded by tannins and tight acidity. Drink by 2015.",Les Baronnes,25,Loire Valley,Sancerre,RosÌ©,Henri Bourgeois
Argentina,"Jammy cassis, blackberry and foxy aromas define the nose on this lush, almost ponderous blend of Malbec, Bonarda and Petit Verdot. There's flatness to the palate along with flavors of blackbery, plum and dark, minty oak. A heavy, grabby finish is bold and voluminous.",Terroir Series Corte Malbec-Bonarda-Petit Verdot,18,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Red Blend,Kaiken
Italy,"This is rather subdued but after ample time in the glass it reveals aromas of oak, toast, espresso and chocolate that continue on to the palate along with vanilla notes. It lacks the vintage's hallmark intensity. Drying tannins give an astringent finish.",Coste di Rose,90,Piedmont,Barolo,Nebbiolo,Marchesi di Barolo
Italy,"Pretty aromas include violet, crushed berries and a balsamic note. But the palate isn't very expressive, offering up raw Morello cherry and espresso notes alongside racy acidity and astringent tannins. Drink after 2020.",Bricco delle Viole,58,Piedmont,Barolo,Nebbiolo,Mario Marengo
US,"Old Wente clones drive the richness of this wine, a mix of lemon, oak and fennel, with a touch of spice on the finish.

Argentina,"There's a mix of herbal aromas and raisin on this blend of Malbec, Merlot, Cab Sauvignon and Syrah. In the mouth, it's edgy and rubbery, with rock-hard tannins.

This will need a lot of air and also hearty  food to show its better side.",Grand Reserve Winemaker's Selection,25,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Red Blend,Proemio
US,"This is a rich, broad-shouldered Pinot Noir, woodsy and oaky with a firm and fierce grip on the palate. It leans more toward earth and smoke than exuberant fruit. Textured in soft undertones of silk, it also offers plenty of fresh herb, a component to take advantage of in pairing.",Brown Ranch,72,California,Carneros,Pinot Noir,Saintsbury
US,"A delicate, almost fragile wine, this opens with tart fruit flavors of strawberry and red plum. There's more than enough acidity, smooth tannins, and a graceful flow to the wine, ending with a light dusting of cocoa.",Arbre Vert Vineyard,42,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Siduri
US,"Even with some hours of breathing time, this remains tight and tannic, with compact flavors of black cherry hard candy. A streak of cola is highlighted with brown spices. The wine loses momentum in the finish, which thins out and quickly fades.",La Colina Vineyard,60,Oregon,Dundee Hills,Pinot Noir,Torii Mor
US,"Loaded with scents and flavors of chocolate, mocha and buttered toast, this forward and very pretty wine surrounds a light core of strawberry and cherry fruit. It's polished‰ÛÓeven silky‰ÛÓand very tasty, though without the depth and complexity for long-term aging.",Shea Vineyard,65,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Walt
Spain,"Aromas of stone fruits and citrus are dusty and nice; so is the mouthfeel, which is fresh but shows texture and body. Watermelon, nectarine and citrus flavors finish slightly bitter but within reason.",Vetiver Tempranillo,13,Northern Spain,Rioja,Rosado,Bodegas OntaÌ±Ì?n
Spain,"Despite being nine years old, this comes across young and jammy, with foxy aromas of wild berries and animal fur. The palate is blocky, heavily extracted and fully ripe in feel.
